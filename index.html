        <p class="role">Role:  User Interface Designer & Developer, Tester
</p>
        <p class="description">This is a group project from course CCT204: Design Thinking. Our group used Figma to design a music-dating app “Mate” Prototype with multiple functions. Our group followed the principles of design and went through multiple iterations. We created an idea, did the sketches and sent out a survey. Then we developed the prototype, Alpha Version and the final Beta Version based on user feedback and tests, in order to ensure better user experiences. 
            You may send a request to try the prototype in Figma with this link: https://www.figma.com/proto/YuUZotf1yUbTqbdsh3eNgI/Mate?node-id=1-4&starting-point-node-id=1%3A4&t=lx1DSz38I5oii07S-1
