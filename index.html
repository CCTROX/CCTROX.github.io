        <p class="description">This is a group project. Our group used Figma to design a music-dating app “Mate” with multiple functions. Our group followed the principles of design and went through multiple iterations. We created an idea, did the sketches and sent out a survey. Then we developed the prototype, Alpha Version and the final Beta Version based on user feedback and tests.
